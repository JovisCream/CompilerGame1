MindSweeper
Mindsweeper inspires from the popular Microsoft single-player puzzle video game, Minesweeper where the objective of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing “hidden” bombs without detonating any of them. The unique feature of Mindsweeper is that it is a text-based game where the user can input commands by placing his desired position through the following elements:
Direction – where a certain position may come from the 4 fundamental directions namely: NORTH, EAST, WEST and South.
Position – the location of the “land” where it may contain a bomb. Positions may vary according to the directions mentioned by the user.
Random – A user can pick the random direction if he desired so that his luck may also changes depending on the result of the given direction.
